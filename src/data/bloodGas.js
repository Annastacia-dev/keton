        "Our next generation of blood gas analyzers",
        "The OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer:\nProvides fast accurate results for blood gases, acid-base balance, electrolytes, ionized calcium, glucose, and lactate.\nRuns samples of whole blood, plasma and serum on single-use disposable cassettes.\nUses innovative optical technology.\nRequires minimal maintenance.",
        "The OPTI CCA-TS2 Blood Gas and Electrolyte Analyzer is a microprocessor-based instrument that measures optical fluorescence from discreet sensors called optical electrodes (optodes). A disposable, single-use cassette contains all of the elements needed for calibration, sample measurement and waste containment. Specific calibration information from the cassette is read into the analyzer by swiping the cassette package through the bar-code reader. The cassette is then placed into the measurement chamber."

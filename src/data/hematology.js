        'Phoenix NCC-61 is one of the latest achievements from Neomedica in the field of hematology which has gained great attention from the date of its launching and which has already found its way on many markets. As one of the closed systems currently in our offer, this analyzer uses only 4 onboard reagents for 5-diff analysis (1 sheath) with RF cards which account for smooth operation and ensure precise results. Sophisticated flow cytometry technology, intelligent detection and maintenance mechanisms that facilitate handling and troubleshooting figure as key elements in the satisfaction of the customers, whose numbers rise by the day. Due to its compact size and weight, small and medium-sized labs in need of fast yet precise 5-differential results comprise the ideal niche for this device. Cyanide-free reagents with long shelf-life and improved packaging enable easy handling and the extremely low consumption makes this analyzer a very favourable and attractive option.',

        'Phoenix NCC-51 is an important part of Neomedica’s 5-diff portfolio and has already proven itself as a gold standard for comprehensive results in labs and hospitals of moderate workload and throughput. Alongside only 4 onboard reagents (1 sheath), this analyzer uses a separate reagent for reticulocyte analysis as an additional benefit to medical practitioners. With 4 different determination methods and through calculations of different angles via laser scatters, this instrument delivers the complete picture, including cell size, granularity and complexity. Characterized by simplicity in operation, a comprehensive QC program and high-quality reagents, this robust device serves to improve the quality of healthcare and to reduce the costs by minimizing the consumption and providing fast, reliable and accurate results at the same time.',

        "Genrui 3 part differential hematology analyzer uses Coulter's Principle and is able to differentiate between 3 types of WBC's, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. In a 3 part hematology analyzer basophils and eosinophils cannot be differentiated and are grouped with a population of either neutrophils or monocytes.",

        'KT-40 is a latest design 3-part hematology. Equipped with high technical smart counting mode and RFID card closed system, KT-40 only needs 9μl sample, could provide better repeatability for low WBC/PLT value samples and realize the real closed system. Besides, wider linearity brings the more widely clinical application. It’s the best choice for small to medium labs.',

      description: [
        ' The PCRmax Eco 48 utilises patented block and optical technologies to deliver extreme speed, sensitivity and data quality, with optimised protocol as fast as 15 minutes, all using standard plasticware and consumables, sensitivity down to 1 copy detection and the world most accurate block the Eco 48 will deliver Speed. Confidence. Performance. Value and Sensitivity.',
        'The PCRmax Eco 48 real time PCR system is a high specification, economically priced real time thermal cycler that accommodates a unique 48-well polypropylene PCR plate utilising the same geometry as standard 384-well plates, but only 1/8 of the size. This enables users to dramatically reduce the qPCR reagent volumes compared to traditional 96-well instruments, whilst still producing a strong fluorescence signal. Minimizing the plate size also significantly improves thermal uniformity. A minimum volume of 5µl is validated, cutting reagent costs in half and making more efficient use of expensive and hard to acquire template DNA samples.',
        'The Eco 48 workflow is based on three simple steps:\nLoad samples into the 48-well plate using the backlit Eco Dock and place the plate into the Eco 48.\nRun experiment.\nThe Eco 48 software provides instrument control, data collection, and data analysis. The most common qPCR parameters are automatically in place. These can be easily changed on the computer to meet specific experimental requirements.',

      short_description:
        'SLA-E13200 is a magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction system, fully automated, can process 1 to 32 samples simultaneously within a short period of time (40 to 60 min), to obtain high purity nucleic acid. The instrument easy operation eliminates the risk of human error and cross-contamination, replacing traditional centrifuge method.',
